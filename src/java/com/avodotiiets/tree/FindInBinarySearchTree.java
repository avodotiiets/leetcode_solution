/**
 * Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST
 * that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node.
 * If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * <p>
 * Given the tree:
 * 4
 * / \
 * 2   7
 * / \
 * 1   3
 * <p>
 * And the value to search: 2
 * You should return this subtree:
 * <p>
 * 2
 * / \
 * 1   3
 * In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no node with value 5, we should return NULL.
 * <p>
 * Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as [],
